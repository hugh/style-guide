  <h2>Lumber Run</h2>
  <p>Tuesday morning, Feb 11th. Drove out to Anderson's first &mdash; they had <strong>garbage</strong> this week. Seriously, the cherry was mostly sapwood and the stuff that wasn't was twisted like a corkscrew. Waste of 45 minutes.</p>
  <p>Ended up driving another 30 minutes to Morrison's. They always have better cherry anyway, I just hate the drive. Found some beautiful 5/4 stock, mostly heartwood, reasonable grain. Loaded up.</p>

  <div class="margin-note">Anderson's used to be good. Something changed in the last year. Their kiln schedule maybe? Everything comes out stressed and moves the second you crosscut it.</div>

  <h3>What I Bought</h3>
  <div class="flow-grid">
    <div class="flow-card capture">
      <div class="card-icon">&#127826;</div>
      <h4>5/4 Cherry</h4>
      <p>About 35 board feet. $12.50/bf, which is highway robbery but whatever. Morrison's knows they've got the only decent cherry within an hour's drive. Three boards at 8&ndash;9" wide, beautiful color.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flow-card refine">
      <div class="card-icon">&#127809;</div>
      <h4>4/4 Cherry</h4>
      <p>Another 20 bf for the back panels and drawer bottoms. $9.80/bf. A little more sapwood in these but it won't show. <span class="scrawl">Hope 20 is enough</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="flow-card execute">
      <div class="card-icon">&#128296;</div>
      <h4>Poplar for Drawers</h4>
      <p>Cheap secondary wood for drawer sides and internal parts. $3.20/bf. Got 15 bf. Poplar machines like a dream, no reason to use cherry where nobody will see it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flow-card batch">
      <div class="card-icon">&#128295;</div>
      <h4>Hardware</h4>
      <p>Brusso solid brass butt hinges for the doors ($48 each, yes I know). Horton Brasses pulls in the antique finish. Woodcraft gift card covered part of it, thank god.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="callout coffee-ring"><p><strong>Total damage:</strong> About $680 in lumber and hardware. That doesn't include the new router bit I "needed" or the $14 coffee and sandwich from the place next to Morrison's. Call it $720 all-in. <span class="scrawl">My wife doesn't need to know the exact number.</span></p></div>

  <div class="section-num">02 &mdash; the plan (version 3)</div>
  <h2>Design &mdash; <span class="struck">Shaker Inspired</span> <span class="amended">Sort of Shaker-ish</span></h2>
  <p>The original plan was a clean Shaker sideboard. Then I saw some Arts &amp; Crafts hardware. Then I found that magazine page again and realized the piece I liked was actually more Federal. So now it's... a mix. <span class="scrawl">Just calling it "mine" at this point.</span></p>

  <div class="margin-note">Stop looking at magazines. Every time I look at a magazine the design changes. My wife suggested I stop looking at magazines. She's right. I won't stop.</div>

    <h3>Overall Dimensions</h3>
    <p>Standard sideboard proportions. <span class="struck">36" tall, 54" wide</span> <span class="amended">34" tall, 52" wide</span> &mdash; shortened it after mocking up with cardboard. The extra 2 inches looked top-heavy in the room.</p>

    <h3>Three Drawers Over Two Doors</h3>
    <p>Top section has three equal drawers side by side. Bottom has two frame-and-panel doors with a fixed shelf behind each. The <span class="pencil-underline">drawer spacing</span> needs to be dead even or it'll look terrible.</p>

  <p class="scrawl" style="margin-top:1rem;">Feb 14th update: Moved the drawers down 1/4" to give more visual weight to the top edge. Looks better. Happy accident &mdash; the adjustment also gives me more room for the drawer slides.</p>

  <h2>Build Plan</h2>
  <p>Writing this out mostly to keep myself honest. I have a habit of jumping ahead to the fun joinery and then realizing I haven't milled everything yet.</p>

  <div class="margin-note">The "sit and wait" step is where I always fail. I get impatient. The wood doesn't care about my schedule. Last time I skipped this step the top developed a 1/8" cup across 18 inches. Never again.</div>

  <h3>Key Principles</h3>
  <div class="principle-list">
    <div class="principle"><div class="principle-num">1</div><div><h4>Mill in Stages</h4><p>Rough mill to 1/4" over. Let it sit. Then final mill. Yes this takes longer. Yes it matters. I've ruined enough panels to know.</p></div></div>
    <div class="principle"><div class="principle-num">2</div><div><h4>Dry Fit Everything</h4><p>Every joint gets a full dry assembly before any glue comes out. No exceptions. Even when I'm tired and it's 10pm and I just want to see it together.</p></div></div>
    <div class="principle"><div class="principle-num">3</div><div><h4>Finish Before Assembly</h4><p><span class="struck">Pre-finish all interior surfaces</span> <span class="amended">Pre-finish interior + test on scrap first</span>.

    <div class="principle"><div class="principle-num">4</div><div><h4>Label Everything</h4><p>Blue painter's tape on every part. Front face, orientation, match marks on joints. Future me will thank present me. Past me never did this and past me was an idiot.</p></div></div>

  <h2>Saturday, Feb 15th</h2>
  <p>Heater broke again. Working in 45&deg;F. Wore two flannels and my ski gloves for the rough work, which made everything take twice as long. Hands were too cold for hand tools so I stuck with machines today.</p>

  <div class="section-num">05 &mdash; the pivot</div>
  <h2>Change of Plans (Feb 19th)</h2>
  <p>OK so here's what happened. I was doing a dry layout of the drawer fronts on the bench and realized the grain pattern across all three drawers looked <strong>wrong</strong>. The middle board had a big swirly cathedral pattern and the two flanking boards were straight-grained. It looked like a face staring at me.</p>

  <div class="margin-note">My daughter said it looked like a surprised owl. She's not wrong. Can't unsee it now.</div>

  <p>So I pulled one of the boards I had set aside for the back and swapped it in as the center drawer front. This means I'm now one back board short, which means another trip to Morrison's, which means another $40 in lumber plus gas plus the sandwich I'll inevitably buy.</p>

  <p><span class="struck">Sticking with the original grain layout</span> <span class="amended">Swapped center drawer front with back board #3</span>. The new layout looks much more cohesive. All three drawer fronts have similar straight grain now. Worth the hassle and the extra trip.</p>

  <div class="blueprint-card coffee-ring">
    <div class="blueprint-title">Sketch 05 &mdash; Revised Drawer Front Layout</div>
    <h3>Grain Matching, Take 2</h3>
    <p>New arrangement: boards 2, 7, and 3 (renumbered). The cathedrals are all subtle and similar in scale. The eye flows across all three drawers without any one demanding attention.</p>

      <span class="blueprint-measurement">L drawer: Board #2</span>

  <p class="scrawl">Lesson learned: always lay out ALL your show faces together before committing to rough dimensions. Photograph them. Sleep on it. I skipped this step because I was excited and cold.</p>

  <p class="scrawl" style="text-align:center; margin-top:0.5rem;">Very much not to scale. The drawers are way deeper than this makes them look.</p>

  <h3>Finish Plan</h3>
  <p>Going with <span class="struck">amber shellac</span> <span class="amended">blonde shellac</span> because amber was darkening the cherry too much in my test on a cutoff. Cherry darkens enough on its own with time &mdash; no need to help it along. Followed by paste wax.</p>

  <div class="flow-grid">
    <div class="flow-card capture taped" style="overflow:visible;">
      <div class="card-icon">&#128295;</div>
      <h4>Step 1: Sand</h4>
      <p>Progressive grits: 120, 150, 180, 220. Raise the grain with a damp rag between 150 and 180. Don't skip this or you'll get blotchy finish. Ask me how I know.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flow-card refine pinned">
      <div class="card-icon">&#127794;</div>
      <h4>Step 2: Seal</h4>
      <p>Thin coat of blonde shellac, 1-lb cut. Let dry 2 hours. Sand back lightly with 320 &mdash; just to de-nib. This evens out the absorption so the topcoats go on uniform.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flow-card execute">
      <div class="card-icon">&#128208;</div>
      <h4>Step 3: Topcoat</h4>
      <p>Two more coats of shellac at 2-lb cut. Pad it on with a cotton ball wrapped in old t-shirt material. The French polish method but I'm not going for a mirror finish. Just smooth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flow-card batch dog-ear">
      <div class="card-icon">&#128296;</div>
      <h4>Step 4: Wax</h4>
      <p>Briwax over everything once the shellac has cured for a couple days. Buff with a soft cloth. This gives it that "old furniture" feel that I'm going for. My wife called it "grandma's house" which I choose to take as a compliment.</p>

  <div class="callout"><p><strong>Running total: $1,039.50</strong>. We are well past "a few hundred." If anyone asks, this is a $200 project. <span class="scrawl">Technically it was $200 if you only count the first trip and nothing else. So not a lie.</span></p></div>

  <div class="margin-note">The sandwiches from that place are legitimately the best part of going to Morrison's. They do a smoked turkey on sourdough with some kind of chipotle mayo situation. Worth the 30-minute drive by itself honestly.</div>
