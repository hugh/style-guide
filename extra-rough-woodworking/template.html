  <h2>The Case for a New Bench</h2>
  <div class="date-stamp">jan 27</div>
  <p>I've been putting this off for about two years. The current bench is one I built when I was first starting out and honestly it shows. The top has a <span class="struck">1/4 inch</span> <span class="amended">3/8 inch</span> twist corner to corner, one of the legs is shimmed with a piece of cardboard (don't judge me), and the vise has been loose since October.</p>

  <div class="margin-note">The shim is from a pizza box. It's been there for 14 months. This is not a joke.</div>

  <p>So the plan is: tear down the old bench, salvage what lumber I can, buy the rest, and build a proper Roubo-style bench. I watched about <strong>40 hours</strong> of YouTube videos on this. I feel ready. <span class="scrawl">(I am not ready.)</span></p>

  <div class="flow-grid">
    <div class="flow-card capture"><div class="card-icon">&#128296;</div><h4>Thick Laminated Top</h4><p>At least 3 inches thick. Maybe 4. Need it HEAVY so it doesn't move when I'm planing. The old top is only 1.5" and it bounces around like a trampoline.</p></div>
    <div class="flow-card refine"><div class="card-icon">&#128207;</div><h4>Leg Vise</h4><p><span class="struck">Twin screw vise</span> <span class="amended">Leg vise with Benchcrafted hardware</span>. Changed my mind after watching the Wood By Wright video. A leg vise just makes more sense for hand tool work.</p></div>
    <div class="flow-card execute"><div class="card-icon">&#127794;</div><h4>Proper Joinery</h4><p>Mortise and tenon for the base. No screws. No pocket holes. <span class="scrawl">I know, I know, there's nothing wrong with pocket holes but this is for ME</span></p></div>
    <div class="flow-card batch"><div class="card-icon">&#128295;</div><h4>Dog Holes</h4><p>3/4" dog holes on 4" centers. Already bought the Veritas brass dogs. They've been sitting on the shelf for 6 months waiting for this bench.</p></div>
  </div>

  <div class="sticky-note sticky-yellow" style="margin-left:3rem;">DON'T FORGET: buy more clamps. You always need more clamps. ALWAYS.</div>

  <div class="callout"><p><strong>Inspiration:</strong> The Anarchist's Workbench by Chris Schwarz (free PDF!). Also Rex Krueger's YouTube series. Also that one guy on Instagram who built a bench out of construction lumber and it looked incredible and made me feel simultaneously inspired and inadequate.</p></div>

  <h2>Lumber Acquisition</h2>
  <div class="date-stamp">feb 3</div>
  <p>Went to the lumber yard this morning. Prices are... OK let's just say I stood in the hardwood aisle for about twenty minutes doing math in my head and feeling sad.</p>
  <p>Original plan was all hard maple for the top. New plan after seeing the prices is <span class="struck">Douglas fir</span> <span class="struck">southern yellow pine</span> <span class="amended">a mix of SYP and some maple I already have</span>. Chris Schwarz says SYP is fine for a bench. Good enough for me.</p>

  <div class="margin-note">The dog followed me around the lumber yard. She is not helpful. She sniffed every board and approved none of them.</div>

  <h3>Price List (RIP my wallet)</h3>

  <table class="info-table">
    <thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Qty</th><th>Price</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>SYP 2x12x10'</td><td>8</td><td><span class="struck">$14.50 ea</span> <span class="amended">$16.80 ea</span></td><td>Price went up AGAIN</td></tr>
      <tr><td>SYP 2x6x10'</td><td>4</td><td>$8.90 ea</td><td>For the stretchers</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Maple 8/4 (had)</td><td>~20bf</td><td>Free (already owned)</td><td>From the bookcase project scraps</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Benchcrafted leg vise</td><td>1</td><td><span class="struck">$195</span> <span class="amended">$215</span></td><td>Price increase since I last looked. Of course.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Titebond III</td><td>2 gal</td><td>$38</td><td>One is never enough for a bench</td></tr>
      <tr><td>3/4" Forstner bit</td><td>1</td><td>$22</td><td>For dog holes. My old one is toast.</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <div class="sticky-note sticky-pink" style="margin-left:1rem;">Total damage: ~$450. I told my wife it was "around $300." This is fine. Everything is fine.</div>

  <div class="margin-note contradicts">Update feb 6: actually it was more like $480 because I also bought a new combination square because the old one was out of square. The irony.</div>

  <h3>Lumber Selection</h3>
  <p>Spent about 45 minutes picking through the SYP stack. Looking for straight grain, no big knots in the first 6 feet, and no twist. Found 6 really good boards and 2 acceptable ones. The shop radio was playing that podcast about medieval timber framing and I felt very inspired while sorting through 2x12s. It's the little things.</p>

  <h2>Saying Goodbye to the Old Bench</h2>
  <div class="date-stamp">feb 8 &mdash; finally</div>
  <p>Tore down the old bench today. It was weirdly emotional? Like, I built my first dovetails on this thing. Also my first <em>terrible</em> dovetails. And my second terrible dovetails. The top is going in the kindling pile but I'm keeping the legs &mdash; they're actually decent maple and I can reuse them for something.</p>

  <div class="callout ink-blot"><p><strong>Salvage report:</strong> 4 maple legs (usable), the old Record vise (still works, keeping as backup), a bunch of screws I'll throw in the jar, and the shim from the pizza box which I am keeping for sentimental reasons. <span class="scrawl">It was a good pizza.</span></p></div>

  <p>The shop feels weird without a bench. Everything is on the floor. The dog is confused. I'm confused. But it's also exciting because NOW we can start building.</p>

  <div class="margin-note">Shop temperature today: 38F. The space heater is doing its best. My fingers are not doing their best.</div>

  <div class="sticky-note sticky-blue" style="margin-left:2rem;">Reminder: call Mike about borrowing his thickness planer for the top lamination. He said I could borrow it "anytime" which I'm choosing to interpret literally.</div>

    <h3>The Main Slab</h3>
    <p>Roubo-style split top. <span class="struck">72 inches long</span> <span class="amended">78 inches long</span> because I realized I want more room for long boards. <span class="scrawl">Also 78 just feels right, don't ask me why</span></p>

    <p>Four laminated legs, each <span class="struck">3.5" x 3.5"</span> <span class="amended">4" x 4"</span>. Decided to go thicker after reading Paul Sellers' blog. He says you can never have legs that are too thick. I believe him.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="margin-note contradicts">Wait, if the top is 78" and the legs are at 30" then the stretchers would be... hold on... (math) ... 60" not 58". Need to remeasure. MEASURE TWICE.</div>

  <div class="section-num">05 &mdash; milling hell</div>
  <h2>Flattening the Boards</h2>
  <div class="date-stamp">feb 10&ndash;12</div>
  <p>Three days of milling. THREE DAYS. My back is destroyed. The shop is covered in shavings. The dog has shavings in her fur. I have shavings in places I didn't know shavings could get.</p>
  <p>Borrowed Mike's planer as planned. It took two trips to get it in the truck because the first time I forgot the dust hood. Mike was very patient about this.</p>

  <div class="callout"><p><strong>Process:</strong> Joint one face on my #7 jointer plane (the hand tool, not the machine &mdash; I don't have a jointer). Run through Mike's planer to get parallel. Joint one edge. Rip to width on the table saw. Repeat for <strong>eight boards</strong>.</p></div>

  <div class="sticky-note sticky-pink" style="margin-left:4rem;">My #7 weighs about 8 lbs. After 8 boards my arms felt like noodles. Consider buying a powered jointer. <span style="font-size:0.9rem;">(Can't afford a jointer.)</span></div>

  <p>The SYP mills beautifully though. It's soft enough to plane easily but hard enough that the surface is smooth. Two of the boards had a lot of pitch in them and I had to keep wiping down the plane sole with mineral spirits.</p>

  <div class="margin-note">Shop temperature: 42F. Getting warmer. The shavings are actually good insulation, so there's that.</div>

  <!-- A section that's been mostly crossed out -->
  <h3>Original Milling Plan (WRONG)</h3>
  <div class="crossed-out" style="padding:1rem;background:var(--warm-9);border:1px dashed var(--border);margin:1rem 0;">
    <p><strong>Plan A:</strong> Mill all boards to 1.75" thickness, then laminate two layers for a 3.5" top.</p>
    <p>This does NOT work because the boards aren't wide enough after ripping. Need to go with the three-layer approach instead. See updated plan below.</p>
    <p>I spent a whole morning on Plan A before figuring this out. <span class="scrawl">A whole morning.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Updated Plan B:</strong> Mill boards to <span class="struck">1.25"</span> <span class="amended">1.2"</span> thickness, laminate three layers for ~3.6" final thickness. Flatten after glue-up. This gives me much more width flexibility and the top will be heavier, which is good.</p>

  <div class="section-num">06 &mdash; the big glue-up</div>
  <h2>Laminating the Top</h2>
  <div class="date-stamp">feb 15 &mdash; disaster</div>
  <p>OK so. The glue-up. Let me just say this: if you're going to laminate a <span class="struck">72</span> 78-inch benchtop from twelve boards in three layers, you need more clamps than you think you do. <strong>You need more clamps than exist.</strong></p>

  <p>I had 14 clamps. I needed about 22. Had to do it in stages: glue up each layer separately (4 boards each), then glue the layers together. This took two days and approximately 1.5 gallons of Titebond III.</p>

  <div class="sticky-note sticky-yellow" style="margin-left:1rem;">Next bench glue-up: BUY 30 CLAMPS. I don't care what they cost. Borrow from everyone. Rent them if you have to. NOT ENOUGH CLAMPS IS NOT AN OPTION.</div>

  <div class="callout splatter"><p><strong>Disaster report:</strong> During the second layer glue-up, one clamp slipped and the whole assembly slid off the sawhorses. Onto the floor. Onto the dog's water bowl. The dog was not harmed. The water bowl was sacrificed. The glue-up survived by some miracle. I sat on the floor for about ten minutes questioning my life choices. <span class="scrawl">Then I got up and finished the glue-up because that's what woodworkers do.</span></p></div>

  <div class="margin-note">Podcast during glue-up: The Wood Whisperer talking about panel glue-ups. Very relevant. Very calming. I needed the calm.</div>

  <h2>Flattening the Slab</h2>
  <div class="date-stamp">feb 17</div>
  <p>The laminated slab is not flat. Of course it's not flat. Nothing in woodworking is ever flat the first time. It has about <span class="struck">1/8"</span> <span class="amended">3/16"</span> of cup across the width and a very slight wind.</p>

  <p>Time to break out the winding sticks. I made a pair from aluminum angle stock last year and they're one of the best $15 investments I've ever made. Confirmed the wind and marked the high spots with a pencil.</p>

  <p>This is going to be a LOT of hand planing. My #5 jack plane with a cambered blade for rough work, then the #7 to bring it flat, then the #4 smoother for final surface. I might be here for a while.</p>

  <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
  <div class="date-stamp">feb 22</div>
  <p>Today is the day. All the pieces are done. The mortises are chopped. The tenons are fitted. The drawbore holes are drilled. The pegs are whittled. I have glue, a mallet, and a deep sense of anxiety.</p>

  <p><strong>Assembly went... OK.</strong> The short end assemblies went together perfectly. The long stretchers were a fight. One of the tenons was just a hair too tight and I had to persuade it with the mallet and some very targeted language. But everything pulled up tight with the drawbored pegs and it's SOLID. I can stand on it without any flex.</p>

  <div class="sticky-note sticky-yellow" style="margin-left:2rem;">The base weighs approximately one million pounds. Moving it into position required bribing my neighbor with beer. The beer cost more than some of the lumber.</div>

  <p>Now I just need to get the top onto the base, install the vise, drill the dog holes, and apply finish. Just those things. Simple. <span class="scrawl">(narrator: it was not simple)</span></p>

  <h2>Finish &amp; Dog Holes</h2>
  <div class="date-stamp">feb 23</div>

  <p>The bench is assembled. The vise is installed. I drilled 24 dog holes and only messed up one of them (it's slightly off the grid and I'm choosing to ignore it). The Benchcrafted hardware is worth every penny &mdash; the vise is smooth and holds like a dream.</p>

  <h3>Finish</h3>
  <p>Going with a mix of boiled linseed oil and paste wax. The BLO soaks into the SYP beautifully and the wax gives it a nice feel. Three coats of BLO, 24 hours between coats, then paste wax buffed with a rag. The bench will darken over time and that's exactly what I want.</p>

  <div class="callout dog-ear"><p><strong>A note on bench finish:</strong> Don't use poly on a workbench. I know it's tempting. But poly will chip off under use and then you have a bench with patchy, flaking finish. BLO + wax is renewable &mdash; just add more when it looks dry. Chris Schwarz has a whole rant about this and he's right. <span class="scrawl">He's always right about bench stuff.</span></p></div>

  <h2>Was It Worth It?</h2>
  <div class="date-stamp">feb 23 &mdash; done!!!</div>

  <p>Yes. <strong>Absolutely yes.</strong> The new bench is everything the old one wasn't. It's flat, it's heavy, the vise works properly, the dog holes are (mostly) on a grid, and it doesn't have a pizza box shim. These are significant improvements.</p>

  <div class="principle-list">
    <div class="principle"><div class="principle-num">1</div><div><h4>Total Cost</h4><p><span class="struck">~$450</span> <span class="amended">~$510</span> (forgot about the combination square, the extra glue, and the beer for the neighbor). Still way cheaper than buying a comparable bench, which would be $1200+ easy.</p></div></div>
    <div class="principle"><div class="principle-num">2</div><div><h4>Total Time</h4><p>About 4 weekends plus some evening sessions. Maybe 50 hours of actual work? Hard to say because a lot of that was watching YouTube videos and calling it "research."</p></div></div>
    <div class="principle"><div class="principle-num">3</div><div><h4>Mistakes Made</h4><p>Off-center mortise, wrong stretcher length (fixed), Plan A for the milling (abandoned), the Great Clamp Disaster of Feb 15, and one dog hole that's 1/4" off the grid. Acceptable losses.</p></div></div>
    <div class="principle"><div class="principle-num">4</div><div><h4>Things Learned</h4><p>Drawboring is amazing and I'm using it on everything from now on. SYP is an underrated bench wood. You ALWAYS need more clamps. The dog will always be in the way. Fleetwood Mac is ideal planing music.</p></div></div>
  </div>

  <div class="sticky-note sticky-pink" style="margin-left:2rem;">The dog has claimed the space under the new bench as her spot. She fits perfectly. This was not planned but it's the best feature of the whole build.</div>

  <div class="margin-note">Next project on the new bench: a set of sawhorses. Then a tool chest. Then maybe that dining table my wife has been asking about for two years. The bench was step one. Everything else follows.</div>

  <p class="scrawl" style="text-align:center;margin-top:2rem;font-size:1.5rem;">Onward.</p>
