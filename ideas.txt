Style Guide Theme Ideas
=======================

Cartographer
  Aged parchment background, sepia and burnt umber tones, topographic
  contour-line patterns as decorative elements, coordinate grids, legend
  boxes, compass-rose section markers. Fonts: something old-map like
  Cormorant Garamond + a clean body serif.

Terminal
  Pure CRT aesthetic. Black background, phosphor green (or amber) monospace
  text for everything. Scanline overlay texture, command-prompt style section
  headers ($ section --name "Colors"), blinking cursor accents, ASCII
  box-drawing characters for borders instead of CSS borders.

Noir
  Film noir / case file. High-contrast black and white, single red accent.
  Typewriter font (Courier Prime), manila folder card backgrounds, evidence
  tag components, redacted text blocks (black bars over text), crime board
  string-connection diagrams, stamped "CLASSIFIED" labels.

Journalist
  Newspaper broadsheet. Cream newsprint background, multi-column layouts,
  large drop caps, serif-heavy (like a front page), dateline headers, pull
  quote components, byline blocks, "BREAKING" callout banners, thin column
  rules.

Botanist
  Field journal. Warm cream/linen background, earthy greens and warm browns,
  specimen card components (bordered cards with taxonomy labels), pressed-
  flower muted palette, field note callouts with date/location stamps,
  classification tables.

Librarian
  Card catalog warmth. Rich cream, dark walnut brown, gold accents, card-
  catalog-style index cards as components, Dewey decimal section numbering
  (025.4 — Reference), bookplate-style headers, library stamp marks,
  due-date grid tables.

Alchemist
  Medieval manuscript meets mystical. Dark parchment (#1a1510), gold leaf
  accents, ornamental drop caps, ingredient/recipe cards, transmutation
  pipeline (lead → ... → gold), symbol-heavy labels, illuminated manuscript-
  style section openers.

Musician
  Score-inspired. Cream paper, staff lines as horizontal rules, dynamic
  markings as emphasis levels (pp, mp, f, ff), measure/bar components, tempo
  annotations on sections (Allegro — §3), rehearsal-mark section numbering
  (boxed letters), fermata pause symbols for callouts.

Mid-Century Modern
  Warm mustard/teal/coral, atomic-age geometry, retro illustration feel.
  Starburst dividers, boomerang shapes, Googie-inspired angles. Fonts:
  something like Poppins or Futura-adjacent + a warm body sans.

  accents. Heavy decorative rules, engraving-style illustrations, gothic
  drop caps, ribbon banners, medallion section markers.

  overlays, case-file-style components.

Silver Age Pop Art
  Harder Lichtenstein/Warhol lean. Larger Ben-Day dots, flat bright
  backgrounds (not newsprint), primary colors at full saturation, speech
  bubbles as a core layout element. More ironic and playful than the
  current Superhero theme.

Golden Age Pulp
  Grittier and older than Silver Age. Heavily yellowed/aged paper,
  distressed ink-splatter borders, two-tone duochrome palette (e.g.
  red + black only), woodcut energy. Closer to EC horror comics than
  Superman.

Cartoon Network / Animated
  Bright white backgrounds, thick rounded outlines, oversized bubbly
  elements, candy-color palette, bouncy hover animations. Teen Titans
  Go / Powerpuff Girls energy — playful, not epic. Rounded sans-serif
  headings.

Modern Cinematic / MCU

  accent (acid blood). Corrugated metal surface textures, moisture/
  condensation overlays, exposed-rivet borders. Monospace readout font
  for everything (like the Nostromo terminals). Motion-tracker radar
  sweep as a loading/progress component, airlock warning panels,
  bio-scan specimen cards, stencil-stamped section headers (WEYLAND-
  YUTANI corporate style). Dripping/melting divider SVGs.

Underwater / Deep Sea
  Dark abyssal navy-to-black gradient backgrounds, bioluminescent
  accents in electric blue, soft teal, and pale violet. Gentle
  undulating wave-line dividers, bubble particle textures, pressure-
  gauge depth indicators. Rounded organic shapes — no sharp corners.
  Translucent frosted-glass card surfaces like jellyfish membranes.

  textures, corrupted-data callout blocks, neural-link connection
  diagrams, holographic shimmer gradients on cards.

Art Nouveau
  Organic flowing curves and botanical elegance. Muted jewel tones —
  deep teal, dusty rose, antique gold, sage green — on cream or soft
  ivory backgrounds. Mucha-style decorative borders with sinuous
  vine/tendril frames, ornamental header cartouches, flowing hairline
  rules. Elegant serif headings (like Playfair Display), clean serif
  body. Floral corner ornaments on cards, stained-glass panel dividers,
  medallion section markers with organic motifs.

Brutalist Web
  Anti-design aesthetic. Raw concrete grey backgrounds, stark black
  and white, one loud accent (construction orange or safety yellow).
  Oversized type at intentionally awkward scales, system fonts (Arial,
  Times New Roman, Courier), no border-radius anywhere, harsh grid
  with visible structure. Thick raw borders, deliberately crude
  spacing, exposed-grid layouts, monolithic block components, NO
  hover transitions — everything static and heavy.

Vaporwave
  Nostalgic retro-futurism. Pastel pink-to-purple gradient backgrounds,
  cyan and hot magenta accents, chrome/silver metallic text effects.
  Receding perspective grid floor as hero background, Roman bust and
  palm tree decorative elements, glitchy VHS tracking-line dividers,

  for telemetry/data. Red/white/blue semantic colors with NASA worm
  logo energy — clean, confident, engineering-precise.

  Dark charcoal with chemical-red safelight accents, instant-photo
  card components with white borders and slight rotation, contact
  sheet grids, developer-tray progress bars, handwritten caption
  labels (cursive font), film-strip dividers, light-leak gradient
  overlays. Warm grain texture on surfaces, timestamp metadata in
  the style of photo EXIF data. Fonts: a handwriting/cursive font
  for captions (like Caveat), clean sans for body.

  Navy and brass, rope-knot dividers, porthole-framed cards, signal
  flag tag components, lighthouse beacon loading indicator, ship's
