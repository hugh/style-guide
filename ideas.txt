Style Guide Theme Ideas
=======================

Cartographer
  Aged parchment background, sepia and burnt umber tones, topographic
  contour-line patterns as decorative elements, coordinate grids, legend
  boxes, compass-rose section markers. Fonts: something old-map like
  Cormorant Garamond + a clean body serif.

Terminal
  Pure CRT aesthetic. Black background, phosphor green (or amber) monospace
  text for everything. Scanline overlay texture, command-prompt style section
  headers ($ section --name "Colors"), blinking cursor accents, ASCII
  box-drawing characters for borders instead of CSS borders.

Noir
  Film noir / case file. High-contrast black and white, single red accent.
  Typewriter font (Courier Prime), manila folder card backgrounds, evidence
  tag components, redacted text blocks (black bars over text), crime board
  string-connection diagrams, stamped "CLASSIFIED" labels.

Journalist
  Newspaper broadsheet. Cream newsprint background, multi-column layouts,
  large drop caps, serif-heavy (like a front page), dateline headers, pull
  quote components, byline blocks, "BREAKING" callout banners, thin column
  rules.

Botanist
  Field journal. Warm cream/linen background, earthy greens and warm browns,
  specimen card components (bordered cards with taxonomy labels), pressed-
  flower muted palette, field note callouts with date/location stamps,
  classification tables.

Librarian
  Card catalog warmth. Rich cream, dark walnut brown, gold accents, card-
  catalog-style index cards as components, Dewey decimal section numbering
  (025.4 — Reference), bookplate-style headers, library stamp marks,
  due-date grid tables.

Alchemist
  Medieval manuscript meets mystical. Dark parchment (#1a1510), gold leaf
  accents, ornamental drop caps, ingredient/recipe cards, transmutation
  pipeline (lead → ... → gold), symbol-heavy labels, illuminated manuscript-
  style section openers.

Musician
  Score-inspired. Cream paper, staff lines as horizontal rules, dynamic
  markings as emphasis levels (pp, mp, f, ff), measure/bar components, tempo
  annotations on sections (Allegro — §3), rehearsal-mark section numbering
  (boxed letters), fermata pause symbols for callouts.
